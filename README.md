# Accessible Kiosk Design for a Local Nursing Home

This project focused on creating an accessible, interactive kiosk system to improve communication and engagement for elderly residents in a local nursing home.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The primary objective was to design a user-friendly interface that supports elderly users—many with limited tech experience or visual impairments—by offering simplified navigation and accessible interaction methods.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Enhance communication between residents, staff, and maintenance services.
- Design an intuitive interface for residents with varying levels of tech proficiency.
- Offer accessibility options including voice control, magnifier features, and real-time information updates.

---

## 🔍 Discovery Phase

We conducted **focus groups** and **interviews** with nursing home residents and staff to identify needs, barriers, and desired features.

### Key Features Identified

- **Resident Directory:** View names, contact info, and room numbers—sortable by first or last name.
- **Maintenance Requests:** Submit pre-filled or custom requests to maintenance staff or initiate a direct call.
- **Activity Sign-Ups:** Centralized weekly activity, workout, and event scheduling.
- **Transportation Schedule:** Live shuttle and bus tracking with arrival time estimates.
- **Emergency Options:** Quick emergency call button with optional GPS integration.

---

## 🧩 Affinity Diagram

We created an **Affinity Diagram** to group findings from the focus groups into themes like communication, scheduling, usability barriers, and safety needs. This helped inform the layout and feature priorities.

---

## ♿ Key Accessibility Features

- **Voice-Based Interface:** Verbal commands enabled for residents with mobility or vision limitations.
- **Magnifier Tool:** Built-in zoom functionality to support those with low vision.
- **Paper Printouts:** For users unfamiliar with or hesitant about digital screens.
- **Custom Profiles:** Resident-specific accounts for accessing personalized content such as schedules and requests.

---

## 💬 Focus Group Takeaways

- Residents preferred both kiosk access and optional companion mobile apps.
- Simpler UI with large fonts, clear icons, and limited choices per screen improved confidence.
- Voice commands and tactile feedback were consistently requested as must-have features.
- Some residents relied on caretakers; dual-user navigation options were considered.

## 📊 Design Analysis

We reviewed existing kiosk systems and accessibility apps, noting gaps in:

- Personalization
- Emergency response workflows
- Accessibility settings at the user level

---

## 🖍️ Wireframes & Mockups

### Early Sketches

- Paper sketches tested with small resident groups.
- Simplified navigation and button placement based on feedback.

### High-Fidelity Mockups

- Designed in Figma with accessible color contrast and font sizing.
- Included real-time preview of request confirmations and schedules.

---

## 🧪 Prototype

A clickable prototype was developed using Figma to simulate:

- Directory navigation
- Activity sign-up flow
- Emergency button activation

✅ Usability tested with 3 residents and 2 staff members using think-aloud protocols.

---

## 🚀 Outcome

The final design was praised by nursing home administrators and residents for its simplicity, safety features, and accessibility.

We believe this approach could be adapted to other settings like hospitals, senior centers, and rehab facilities to improve autonomy and communication for older adults.
